### Source Code

```
To use this article, check if you got wnaspi32.dll
installed on your system!
First of all:
What the hell is ASPI? -ASPI is a dll(wnaspi32.dll) that
gets and sends data to drives etc.
It's a dll written for c or c++ so you can't call them in VB.
But you can write a wrapper-dll. The dll and its source are included in the zipfile(click on download article)
For example you can use this dll, to fill a listbox with CD-ROM devices installed on your computer.
It could be used to burn files on cd-r.
The example shows you howto search for a CD-ROM device and read the TOC (Table Of Contents) in mins, secs and frms.
Now click on "Download Article" and have phun!!!
